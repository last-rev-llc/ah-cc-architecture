Include slides for: system metrics (number of apps, components, skills), architecture layer stack (apps → components → design system → database → AI runtime), shared component library catalog, app deployment pipeline, database schema overview, automation/cron system, skills ecosystem, memory/context system, design system highlights, and scalability roadmap. Use a dark glass-morphism theme with amber/gold accents. Each slide should be concise with visual hierarchy — headers, stat cards, two-column layouts, and tag clouds where appropriate.",

Include specific examples like cc-app-nav for consistent navigation, cc-auth for password gating, cc-modal for dialogs, cc-empty-state for empty data views, and animation components (fade-in, stagger, reveal) for polished UX. Emphasize the 2-minute deploy time from conversation to live site.",
